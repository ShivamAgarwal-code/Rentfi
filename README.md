# RentFi - One Stop House RWA Rental Financial Platform

Project Overview
Welcome to RentFi, a revolutionary platform transforming the rental experience! As students who've faced rental challenges firsthand, we've created a solution where landlords can list properties, and tenants can effortlessly find their next home. The heart of RentFi lies in its smart contracts, managing everything from payments to guarantees, and ensuring a seamless rental journey.

What makes RentFi unique? The innovation doesn't stop at just renting. Deposits secured in smart contracts aren't idle; they earn interest through DeFi lending protocols like AAVE, benefiting tenants. Landlords have an exciting opportunity too â€“ they can mint rent cash flows paid by tenants as NFTs and trade them in the NFT marketplace, creating a novel investment landscape.

Chainlink Integration
Our platform heavily relies on Chainlink's oracle services. These oracles provide real-time, reliable market data, crucial for accurately pricing rent-based NFTs using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method. This integration not only ensures fair and transparent pricing but also enhances the platform's security and trustworthiness.

Inspiration
The idea for RentFi was born from personal experience. Arriving in Hong Kong for a master's degree, the struggle to secure housing without financial proof was real. After enduring unfair treatment and deposit losses, the motivation to use our knowledge in web3 and smart contracts to create RentFi was undeniable. We aim to prevent others from facing similar challenges.

Platform Mechanics
RentFi is more than just a rental platform; it's a financial ecosystem. By leveraging Chainlink's oracle services, we ensure the DCF method is applied accurately, offering fair and market-reflective pricing for rental agreements treated as bonds. This approach not only empowers new immigrants and students without financial history but also provides landlords and investors with innovative financial tools.

Development Journey
Built on Scaffold-eth2 and developed using Next.js, the platform's deployment is streamlined through Vercel. We've tackled challenges like floating-point computations in blockchain, overcoming them by adopting strategies used in DeFi protocols, thanks to PRBMath libraries.

Challenges & Solutions
Implementing DCF in smart contracts. Harnessing the full potential of smart contract capabilities. Integrating AAVE lending protocols, a task made smoother with Chainlink oracles.

Proud Achievements
Merging DeFi, NFT, and rental logic in a cohesive business model. Utilizing rental deposits in DeFi lending. Transforming rent cash flows into NFTs for innovative financing options.
